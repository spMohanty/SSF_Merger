CHANGELOG
=========
* v0.8
- Adding support for numx, measx and timex as etype values for modified nodes in NER input
* v0.7
- Fixing a major bug from last relase, revolving around support for ne and namex etype values, and adding test cases
* v0.6
- Adding support for 'ne' and 'namex' as etype values for NER input
* v0.5
- Stopped messing around with the etype attribute, and instead introduced a custom attribute called merger_marker which tracks changes in the SSF file. The output SSF file also doesnot mark the etype attribute by chunker_ne_mwe as it did earlier, instead it lets the individual chunks retain there etype, and in case of a conflict, it assigns the etype based on the priority MWE > NER > CHUNKER (can be changed)
- Implementend independent detection of modified nodes, and the merger doesnot expect the modified nodes of any module to be marked by an etype
* v0.4
- Fixed #3 :: Allows for SSF files which have " as a token to be processed (" interfered with XML parsing in the intermediate XML state)
* v0.3
- Fixed SSF output formatting in SSF Api
- Added Changelog
- Added Merging Rules
- Added command line parameters for file input from different streams 
* v0.2
- Base Version
